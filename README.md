## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This challenge focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle. But you could also choose to do this without JS!

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS

### What I learned

It was my first time using SASS. It was difficult to use at first since there were new keywords to use, but I got it done anyway. I would really like to properly organize all my scss next time and also organize my thoughts when building my planning with this new tool.

I also learned of the 12-column grid, which is more of a designer technique, but I applied it here to help with responsiveness and arranging all the elements.

### Useful resources

- [Sass and BEM for beginners by Coder Coder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfMHA8SqUL4) - This helped me get started with using SCSS.

- [How to make full bleed wrappers with CSS grid by Coder Coder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l24PIccgqU) - This
  was suggested while I watched the Sass and BEM for beginners video, and watching this made me realize I could approach building websites with a 12-column grid in mind.
